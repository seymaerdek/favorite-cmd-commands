## 1)git init

With this code i can add a git folder in the current repository. The folder that i make is hidden. I only can see this folder with the "ls -a "code.

## 2)git status

When i write this code on my Git Bash, i can see the status of the files. If it is red, that means there are something new and i can write "add" and "commit" codes. If its green, that means there is nothing new in the files.

## 3)git log

I use this code for seeing what happened previously on my file with the commit codes.Also I can see the deleted ones.
